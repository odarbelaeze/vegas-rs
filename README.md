## Introduction

This is an experimental implementation of an atomistic simulation package for
magnetic systems. **vegas**'s main goal is to determine how performant is the
[rust](www.rust-lang.com) language for this kind of application.

## Installation

To install **vegas** you need to have the rust installed. Then, you can install
**vegas** by running the following command:

```bash
cargo install vegas
```

If you want to install **vegas** as a library, you can add it via cargo:

```bash
cargo add vegas
```

## Features

### As a library

- Statistical metrics accumulators.
- Static dispatching of compund Hamiltonians.
- Pre-defined energy components: Gauge, Exchange, Anisotropy, Zeeman.
- Powerful error handling via the `thiserror` crate.
- Flexible instrumentation system, using dynamic dispatching.
- Support for different integration algorithms such as Metropolis.
- Parquet input output support via the `parquet` crate.
- Pre-defined programs: Relax, CoolDown, HysteresisLoop.

### As a command line tool

You can use the toml input file format to run simulations. An example of input
file is given below:

```toml
# Model definition can be Ising or Heisenberg
model = "Ising"

# You can create unit cells of different lattice types.
[sample.unitcell]
name = "sc"

# You can expand your unit cell to create larger samples.
[sample.size]
x = 10
y = 10
z = 1

# You can set periodic boundary conditions in each direction.
[sample.pbc]
x = true
y = true
z = false


# You can control the steps of the simulation.
[[steps]]
program = "Relax"
steps = 1000
temperature = 4.0

[[steps]]
program = "CoolDown"
max_temperature = 4.0
min_temperature = 0.1
cool_rate = 0.1
relax = 1000
steps = 20000

# You can define outputs to be written during the simulation.
[output]
raw = "./output.parquet"

[output.state]
path = "./state.parquet"
frequency = 1000
```

You can run the simulation by executing the following command:

```bash
vegas run input.toml
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request on
GitHub. There are currently some missing features that would benefit the
package, such as:

- Custom exchange interaction values (so far we only support `1.0`).
- More Hamiltonian terms (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Dipolar, etc).
- More integration algorithms (Wolff, Swendsen-Wang, etc).
